# Football_Analytics

This is a repository containing a subset of the research I have done into football prediction using machine learning.

For proprietary reasons, not all of the code for my project is included here, and data sources have been left out, but
it gives an idea of the work I have done and tools used.

db_handler.py contains code to collect and format data for matches contained in a sqlite database
fifa_data_methods.ipynb shows the basic modelling approach I have taken using neural networks to predict the results of matches
based on player data
probablistic_modelling.ipynb show the start of my research into Bayesian and probabilistic neural networks. This represents the
main focus of my current work, and as such the code is very "research" organised.

Tools used include: Keras, Tensorflow Probability, Pandas, Numpy, matplotlib, SQL
